    <h1>How AI Helps With Disk Cleanup on Mac</h1>
    <p>A practical and safe guide explaining how modern AI tools enhance storage optimization and keep your Mac performing at its best.</p>

<div class="hero">
    <h2>Why AI Matters for Storage Management</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial intelligence has become an essential part of modern macOS optimization.  
        Instead of manually searching through folders, identifying large files, or checking  
        which apps consume the most space, AI-based tools can analyze your system in seconds  
        and provide clear suggestions tailored to your device.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>1. Intelligent File Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        AI algorithms scan your Mac’s storage to highlight unused documents, outdated downloads,  
        duplicate files, or large items you may have forgotten about. Unlike traditional cleaners,  
        AI learns patterns in your personal usage and prioritizes files that are safe to delete.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>2. Smart Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
        Instead of offering generic “clean everything” options, AI provides personalized  
        recommendations such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Files you haven’t opened in months</li>
        <li>Apps rarely used that take a lot of space</li>
        <li>Old screenshots and temporary media</li>
        <li>Cache folders growing unusually large</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>3. Automatic Background Optimization</h2>
    <p>
        Many modern tools use machine learning to maintain clean storage automatically.  
        This includes periodic cache cleanup, managing temporary files, and monitoring  
        storage patterns to prevent your Mac from slowing down.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>4. Cleaner Browser Storage</h2>
    <p>
        AI-based cleaning systems detect unnecessary browser data such as unused cookies,  
        session files, and cached media. This helps browsers like Safari, Chrome, and Firefox  
        run more smoothly without affecting your active logins or personal preferences.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>5. iCloud and Local Storage Balance</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial intelligence can determine which files should stay on your Mac and  
        which can safely move to iCloud for long-term storage. This prevents your disk  
        from filling up while keeping access to important files without interruption.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>6. Performance Benefits of AI Cleanup</h2>
    <p>
        A cleaner system means:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>faster boot times</li>
        <li>smoother multitasking</li>
        <li>more available disk space</li>
        <li>better application performance</li>
        <li>longer SSD lifespan</li>
    </ul>
